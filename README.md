# Orchard FED Test

**Test performed using React + Vite.**

I used React because I know that it is a library that the company uses, so I wanted to show you a little about how I work with this library. In addition, Vite comes configured and helps save time.

I have deployed the test in Netlify, although to run it locally just install the dependencies ```npm install``` and run the following command ```npm run dev```

Thanks for your time.
